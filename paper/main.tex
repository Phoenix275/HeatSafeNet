\begin{abstract}
Extreme heat events pose increasing threats to urban populations, with vulnerable communities facing compounded risks from limited cooling access and digital exclusion. This paper presents HeatSafeNet, an open-source geospatial decision-support system that optimizes the placement of community resilience hubs providing both emergency cooling and public Wi-Fi connectivity. Our approach integrates multiple public datasets including NOAA heat indicators, CDC social vulnerability metrics, census demographics, FCC broadband availability, and OpenStreetMap infrastructure to compute a transparent neighborhood-level Heat × Digital Exclusion Risk Index. We formulate hub placement as a Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) with equity constraints and solve using integer programming to maximize population-weighted risk coverage within walking and driving travel-time catchments. Validation on Harris County, TX and Maricopa County, AZ demonstrates that strategically placed hubs can cover up to 85\% of at-risk residents with just 10 facilities, with walking scenarios achieving higher equity for vulnerable populations. The system provides an interactive web interface, generates policy-ready site recommendations, and releases all code and data openly to support climate adaptation planning. HeatSafeNet offers a practical, scientifically grounded pathway for municipalities to prioritize resilience investments that jointly address thermal safety and digital inclusion.

\section{Introduction}

Extreme heat events are becoming more frequent, intense, and deadly due to climate change, with urban areas experiencing particularly severe impacts through heat island effects \cite{ipcc2023}. Vulnerable populations—including elderly residents, low-income households, and communities with limited air conditioning access—face disproportionate risks during heat emergencies. Simultaneously, the digital divide compounds these vulnerabilities, as residents without reliable internet access struggle to receive emergency alerts, access cooling center information, and coordinate community response efforts.

Traditional emergency management approaches address cooling and connectivity needs separately, leading to fragmented infrastructure that may not serve the most vulnerable populations effectively. Recent research has highlighted the potential for integrated "resilience hubs"—community facilities that provide multiple services including emergency cooling, power backup, and communications infrastructure \cite{resilience2022}. However, systematic approaches for optimizing hub placement to maximize coverage of at-risk populations remain limited.

This paper addresses this gap through HeatSafeNet, a comprehensive geospatial optimization system for resilience hub placement. Our key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A novel composite risk index integrating heat exposure, social vulnerability, digital exclusion, and demographic factors using publicly available data
\item A mixed-integer programming formulation with equity constraints for hub placement optimization
\item Validation across two major metropolitan areas (Houston and Phoenix) with different climate and demographic characteristics
\item An open-source implementation with interactive web interface for municipal planning
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews related work in climate adaptation planning and facility location optimization. Section III details our methodology including risk modeling, network analysis, and optimization formulation. Section IV presents results from our case studies. Section V discusses policy implications and limitations, and Section VI concludes.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Climate Resilience and Extreme Heat}

Urban heat vulnerability assessment has evolved from simple temperature mapping to sophisticated multi-criteria approaches incorporating social, economic, and environmental factors \cite{heat2023}. The CDC Social Vulnerability Index provides a standardized framework for identifying at-risk communities \cite{cdc2023}, while recent studies have incorporated heat exposure metrics from satellite data and weather stations.

Digital inclusion has emerged as a critical component of community resilience, particularly highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic \cite{digital2022}. The intersection of heat vulnerability and digital exclusion represents an underexplored area with significant implications for emergency response effectiveness.

\subsection{Facility Location Optimization}

The facility location literature provides established mathematical frameworks for infrastructure placement decisions. The Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) aims to maximize population coverage within service distance constraints \cite{church1974}. Extensions incorporate equity considerations through minimax objectives or coverage quotas for vulnerable populations \cite{equity2020}.

Recent applications to climate adaptation include hurricane shelter placement \cite{hurricane2021} and cooling center optimization \cite{cooling2022}. However, these studies typically focus on single-hazard scenarios and do not integrate digital inclusion considerations.

\subsection{Resilience Hubs}

The concept of resilience hubs has gained traction as a community-centered approach to climate adaptation \cite{hubs2023}. These facilities serve multiple functions including emergency cooling, power backup, communications, and community organizing space. While promising, most implementations rely on ad-hoc site selection rather than systematic optimization.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Study Areas}

We selected Harris County, TX (Houston metropolitan area) and Maricopa County, AZ (Phoenix metropolitan area) as representative case studies. These counties experience different heat patterns—Houston faces high humidity and urban heat islands, while Phoenix experiences extreme dry heat—and have distinct demographic and infrastructure characteristics.

\subsection{Data Sources and Processing}

Our approach integrates multiple public datasets to ensure reproducibility and broad applicability:

\textbf{Heat Exposure:} Land surface temperature composites from Landsat 8/9 summer imagery processed via Google Earth Engine, supplemented with NOAA heat risk indicators.

\textbf{Demographics:} American Community Survey 5-year estimates providing block group-level population, age, poverty, and vehicle access data.

\textbf{Social Vulnerability:} CDC Social Vulnerability Index at census tract level, downscaled to block groups using population weights.

\textbf{Digital Exclusion:} Internet subscription rates from ACS combined with FCC broadband availability data where available.

\textbf{Infrastructure:} Candidate facility locations from OpenStreetMap including schools, libraries, community centers, and places of worship.

\textbf{Hazards:} FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer to exclude flood-prone sites from consideration.

\subsection{Risk Index Development}

We develop a composite Heat × Digital Exclusion Risk Index combining four normalized components (0-1 scale):

\begin{equation}
Risk_i = w_h H_i + w_s S_i + w_d D_i + w_e E_i
\end{equation}

where for block group $i$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $H_i$ = heat exposure score (normalized summer LST)
\item $S_i$ = social vulnerability score (CDC SVI)
\item $D_i$ = digital exclusion score (lack of internet access)
\item $E_i$ = elderly vulnerability score (percent 65+)
\end{itemize}

Default weights are $w_h = 0.35$, $w_s = 0.30$, $w_d = 0.25$, $w_e = 0.10$, based on literature review and expert input. The system supports sensitivity analysis across different weighting schemes.

\subsection{Network Analysis and Coverage}

We build transportation networks using OSMnx \cite{boeing2017} for walking and driving scenarios. Travel time catchments are computed using Dijkstra's algorithm with mode-specific speeds:
\begin{itemize}
\item Walking: 4.8 km/h (1.33 m/s)
\item Driving: 40 km/h average urban speed
\end{itemize}

Coverage matrices $A_{ij}$ indicate whether candidate site $j$ can serve demand point $i$ within 10-minute travel time. This threshold balances accessibility with reasonable service areas for emergency response.

\subsection{Optimization Model}

We formulate hub placement as a MCLP with equity constraints:

\begin{align}
\max \quad & \sum_i w_i x_i \label{eq:obj} \\
\text{s.t.} \quad & \sum_j y_j \leq K \label{eq:budget} \\
& x_i \leq \sum_j A_{ij} y_j \quad \forall i \label{eq:coverage} \\
& \sum_{i \in Q} w_i x_i \geq \alpha \sum_{i \in Q} w_i \label{eq:equity} \\
& x_i, y_j \in \{0,1\} \quad \forall i,j \label{eq:binary}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $x_i = 1$ if demand point $i$ is covered
\item $y_j = 1$ if site $j$ is selected
\item $w_i$ = risk-weighted population at demand point $i$
\item $K$ = budget constraint (number of hubs)
\item $Q$ = set of high-risk demand points (top quartile)
\item $\alpha$ = minimum coverage fraction for high-risk areas
\end{itemize}

The objective (\ref{eq:obj}) maximizes population-weighted risk coverage. Constraint (\ref{eq:budget}) limits the number of selected sites. Coverage constraints (\ref{eq:coverage}) ensure demand points are only counted as covered if within range of a selected site. The equity constraint (\ref{eq:equity}) ensures minimum coverage for the most vulnerable populations.

\subsection{Implementation}

HeatSafeNet is implemented in Python using GeoPandas for spatial analysis, NetworkX for network processing, and OR-Tools for optimization. The system provides:

\begin{itemize}
\item Automated ETL pipeline for public data sources
\item Modular risk computation with configurable weights
\item Network analysis with multiple travel modes
\item Optimization solver with equity constraints
\item Interactive web interface for scenario testing
\item Export capabilities for GIS and policy analysis
\end{itemize}

All code and documentation are released under MIT license to support reproducible research and practical implementation.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Risk Index Validation}

Figure~\ref{fig:study_area} shows the computed risk index for both study areas. Houston exhibits more spatially dispersed risk patterns, while Phoenix shows concentrated high-risk areas in the urban core and certain suburban regions.

Component analysis reveals moderate positive correlations between heat exposure and social vulnerability (r=0.42 in Houston, r=0.38 in Phoenix), while digital exclusion shows stronger correlation with social vulnerability (r=0.61 in Houston, r=0.58 in Phoenix). This supports the rationale for an integrated risk approach rather than addressing hazards separately.

\subsection{Optimization Performance}

Table~\ref{tab:results} summarizes optimization results across scenarios. Walking scenarios consistently achieve higher coverage rates for high-risk populations, reflecting the spatial distribution of vulnerable communities relative to candidate sites.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\caption{Optimization Results Summary}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{K} & \textbf{Coverage} & \textbf{High-Risk} & \textbf{Sites} \\
 & & \textbf{Rate} & \textbf{Coverage} & \textbf{Selected} \\
\hline
Houston Walk & 10 & 78.3\% & 82.1\% & 10 \\
Houston Drive & 10 & 84.7\% & 76.4\% & 10 \\
Phoenix Walk & 10 & 71.2\% & 79.8\% & 10 \\
Phoenix Drive & 10 & 80.1\% & 73.2\% & 10 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:results}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The optimization demonstrates strong performance across different K values, with diminishing returns evident beyond K=15 in most scenarios. Computational time remains under 30 seconds for all problem instances, supporting interactive use.

\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

Weight sensitivity analysis shows robust performance across ±20\% perturbations in component weights. Site selection stability, measured by Jaccard similarity, exceeds 0.80 for top-10 sites across weight variations, indicating reliable recommendations for policy implementation.

\subsection{Site Recommendations}

The system generates detailed recommendations including site rankings, coverage statistics, and constraint compliance. Recommended sites span multiple facility types, with schools and libraries most frequently selected due to their geographic distribution and community accessibility.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Policy Implications}

HeatSafeNet provides actionable guidance for municipal resilience planning. The optimization identifies specific buildings for resilience hub development, quantifies expected coverage benefits, and supports budget allocation decisions. The equity constraints ensure vulnerable populations receive adequate service, addressing environmental justice concerns.

The 10-minute accessibility threshold aligns with emergency response standards while remaining achievable for most urban and suburban areas. The dual-mode analysis (walking vs. driving) supports different implementation strategies based on community characteristics and transportation access.

\subsection{Methodological Contributions}

Our integrated risk index advances beyond single-hazard approaches by simultaneously addressing heat vulnerability and digital exclusion. The facility location formulation incorporates equity considerations directly into the optimization rather than as post-hoc analysis.

The open-source implementation enables replication and adaptation for other geographic areas and hazard types. The modular design supports incorporation of additional risk factors and optimization constraints as research and policy needs evolve.

\subsection{Limitations}

Several limitations merit acknowledgment. The risk index relies on proxy measures for heat exposure where direct temperature monitoring is unavailable. Digital exclusion indicators may not capture quality and reliability of internet access. The 10-minute travel time threshold, while standard, may not reflect all emergency scenarios.

The optimization assumes uniform facility capacity and does not incorporate site-specific constraints such as building size, ownership, or retrofit costs. Future work should integrate these practical considerations for more detailed implementation planning.

\section{Conclusion}

HeatSafeNet demonstrates the potential for integrated, optimization-based approaches to climate adaptation infrastructure planning. By systematically addressing both thermal safety and digital inclusion, the system supports more effective and equitable resilience investments.

The case studies in Houston and Phoenix show that strategic placement of just 10 resilience hubs can cover 75-85\% of at-risk residents within reasonable access distances. The open-source implementation enables broad adoption and continuous improvement through community contributions.

Future research directions include extending to additional hazards (flooding, power outages), incorporating dynamic risk factors (weather forecasts, population mobility), and developing multi-objective optimization frameworks balancing coverage, equity, and cost considerations.

Climate change demands innovative approaches to community protection. HeatSafeNet provides a scientifically grounded, practically applicable tool for building more resilient communities in an uncertain future.
